# Thermodynamics

## The Four Laws
- The Zeroth Law states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in equilibrium with each other | Thermodynamic Laws | 0.94
- The First Law of Thermodynamics, or Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another | Thermodynamic Laws | 0.96
- The Second Law states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time; it can only remain constant or increase | Thermodynamic Laws | 0.96
- The Third Law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum | Thermodynamic Laws | 0.93
- Energy balance for a closed system is defined as ΔU = Q - W, where U is internal energy, Q is heat added, and W is work done | Energy Balance | 0.94

## Phase Transitions and States
- A phase transition is the transformation of a thermodynamic system from one state of matter to another | Phase Transitions | 0.95
- The Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) is the temperature range where an amorphous material changes from a hard, glassy state to a viscous, rubbery state | Glass Transition | 0.92
- Melting point (Tm) is the temperature at which a solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium at a given pressure | Phase Equilibrium | 0.95
- Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released by a substance during a change in its physical state without changing its temperature | Latent Heat | 0.94
- Enthalpy of fusion is the heat energy required to change a unit of substance from solid to liquid at constant pressure | Phase Changes | 0.93
- Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at a given temperature | Vapor Properties | 0.93

## Chemical Kinetics and Rates
- Reaction kinetics describes the rate at which a chemical process occurs and the factors that affect this speed | Reaction Kinetics | 0.94
- Temperature increase generally increases reaction rates by providing particles with more kinetic energy to overcome activation barriers | Reaction Rate | 0.95
- Activation Energy (Ea) is the minimum amount of energy required to initiate a chemical reaction | Chemical Kinetics | 0.95
- The Arrhenius Equation, k = Ae^(-Ea/RT), relates the rate constant of a reaction to temperature and activation energy | Rate Equations | 0.92
- Catalysts lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed faster without being consumed in the process | Catalysis | 0.95
- Water content in a system can act as a plasticizer, significantly lowering the glass transition temperature of polymers | Polymer Properties | 0.90

## Gibbs Free Energy and Spontaneity
- Gibbs Free Energy (G) determines the spontaneity of a process at constant temperature and pressure | Thermodynamic Functions | 0.94
- The equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS relates Gibbs free energy to enthalpy, entropy, and temperature | Energy Equations | 0.94
- A process is spontaneous when ΔG is negative and non-spontaneous when ΔG is positive | Spontaneity | 0.95
- At equilibrium, ΔG equals zero and the system experiences no net change | Equilibrium | 0.95
