# Formal Logic

## Fundamentals of Propositional Logic
- A proposition is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both | Propositional Logic | 0.96
- Logical operators (connectives) are used to combine propositions into complex statements | Propositional Logic | 0.95
- Negation (NOT) reverses the truth value of a proposition; if P is true, ¬P is false | Logical Operators | 0.96
- Conjunction (AND) is true only if both propositions are true | Logical Operators | 0.96
- Disjunction (OR) is true if at least one of the propositions is true | Logical Operators | 0.96
- Material implication (IF...THEN) is false only if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false | Logical Operators | 0.95
- Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF) is true only if both propositions have the same truth value | Logical Operators | 0.94

## Deductive Reasoning and Syllogisms
- Deduction is a form of reasoning where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises | Deductive Logic | 0.96
- A syllogism is a logical argument consisting of two premises and a conclusion | Syllogisms | 0.95
- Modus Ponens is a valid argument form: If P→Q and P, then Q | Argument Forms | 0.95
- Modus Tollens is a valid argument form: If P→Q and ¬Q, then ¬P | Argument Forms | 0.95
- Validity refers to the structure of an argument; an argument is valid if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false | Validity | 0.96
- Soundness occurs when an argument is valid and all its premises are actually true | Soundness | 0.95

## Predicate Logic and Quantifiers
- Predicate logic extends propositional logic by using variables and quantifiers to describe properties of objects | Predicate Logic | 0.94
- The Universal Quantifier (∀) indicates that a property holds for all members of a domain | Quantifiers | 0.95
- The Existential Quantifier (∃) indicates that a property holds for at least one member of a domain | Quantifiers | 0.95
- A domain of discourse is the set of all objects under consideration in a particular logical context | Domains | 0.94
- Bound variables are variables within the scope of a quantifier; free variables are not | Variable Binding | 0.93

## Logical Equivalence and Tautologies
- A tautology is a proposition that is always true regardless of the truth values of its component parts | Tautologies | 0.95
- A contradiction is a proposition that is always false regardless of the truth values of its components | Contradictions | 0.95
- Logical equivalence holds when two propositions have the same truth value in all possible cases | Equivalence | 0.95
- De Morgan's Laws state that ¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) and ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ (¬P ∧ ¬Q) | Laws of Logic | 0.94

## Logical Fallacies and Arguments
- A fallacy is a defective argument that fails to establish its conclusion, even if it appears convincing | Fallacies | 0.94
- Affirming the consequent is a fallacy: If P→Q and Q, it is invalid to conclude P | Common Fallacies | 0.95
- Denying the antecedent is a fallacy: If P→Q and ¬P, it is invalid to conclude ¬Q | Common Fallacies | 0.95
- Begging the question occurs when the conclusion is simply assumed as one of the premises | Informal Fallacies | 0.93
