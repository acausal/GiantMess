# Biology

## The Molecular Building Blocks
- Proteins are large biomolecules consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues | Macromolecules | 0.96
- Enzymes are biological catalysts that significantly speed up chemical reactions within cells without being consumed | Catalysis | 0.95
- Carbohydrates are organic compounds (sugars, starches, cellulose) that serve as primary energy sources and structural components | Macromolecules | 0.95
- Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, including fats, waxes, and sterols, essential for cell membranes and energy storage | Macromolecules | 0.94
- Nucleic Acids (DNA and RNA) are the biopolymers that store and transmit genetic information | Macromolecules | 0.96

## Cell Biology
- The Cell is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known organisms | Cell Theory | 0.96
- Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria), whereas Eukaryotic cells contain them (e.g., plants, animals) | Cell Types | 0.95
- The Cell Membrane is a selectively permeable barrier that controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell | Cell Structure | 0.95
- Mitochondria are organelles that generate energy for the cell through cellular respiration | Cell Organelles | 0.95
- Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells where photosynthesis occurs | Cell Organelles | 0.94

## Genetics and Heredity
- A Gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function | Genetics | 0.96
- The Central Dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information: DNA → RNA → Protein | Molecular Biology | 0.95
- Chromosomes are structures composed of DNA and proteins that carry genetic information | Genetics | 0.95
- Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence that can alter the characteristics of an organism | Genetics | 0.93
- Sexual reproduction produces genetic variation through the combination of genetic material from two parents | Reproduction | 0.95

## Organismal Systems
- Homeostasis is the state of steady internal, physical, and chemical conditions maintained by living systems | Physiology | 0.95
- An Ecosystem consists of all the organisms and the physical environment with which they interact | Ecology | 0.95
- Population is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same geographic area | Ecology | 0.96
- Predation is an interaction between organisms where one organism (predator) hunts and consumes another (prey) | Ecology | 0.94
- Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water | Metabolism | 0.95
