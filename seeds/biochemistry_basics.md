# Biochemistry

## Cellular Metabolism
- Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms, divided into Catabolism (breaking down) and Anabolism (building up) | Metabolic Pathways | 0.96
- ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of the cell, providing energy for many metabolic processes | Bioenergetics | 0.96
- Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, yielding ATP and NADH | Metabolic Pathways | 0.94
- The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle) is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy | Metabolic Pathways | 0.94
- Oxidative Phosphorylation is the process by which ATP is synthesized when electrons are transferred from NADH or FADH2 to oxygen | Bioenergetics | 0.92

## Biochemistry of Polymers
- Biopolymers are polymers produced by living organisms (e.g., cellulose, starch, proteins, DNA) | Polymer Chemistry | 0.95
- Hydrolysis is a chemical process of decomposition involving the splitting of a bond and the addition of the hydrogen cation and the hydroxide anion of water | Chemical Reactions | 0.93
- Polymerization is the process of chemically combining many monomers to form a polymer | Polymer Chemistry | 0.95
- Amino acids are organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins | Protein Chemistry | 0.96
- Peptide Bonds link amino acids together in proteins through a dehydration synthesis reaction | Protein Chemistry | 0.94

## Biodegradation and Environmental Chemistry
- Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic substances by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae | Biodegradation | 0.94
- Microbial degradation of plastics often involves extracellular enzymes that break down long polymer chains into smaller, absorbable molecules | Biodegradation | 0.91
- Composting is a specific aerobic process of biodegradation that transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment | Biodegradation | 0.93
- Enzyme Kinetics describes the rate at which enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions | Enzyme Chemistry | 0.92
- Cofactors are inorganic substances (metal ions or coenzymes) that many enzymes require to function | Enzyme Chemistry | 0.91

## Signaling and Regulation
- Cellular Signaling is the process by which cells respond to external signals or stimuli | Cell Biology | 0.92
- Receptors are proteins that bind signaling molecules (ligands) and initiate cellular responses | Molecular Biology | 0.94
- Biomimicry is the design and production of materials, structures, and systems that are modeled on biological entities and processes | Biotechnology | 0.91
