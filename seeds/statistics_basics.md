# Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics
- Mean is the average of a data set, calculated by dividing the sum of all values by the number of values | Descriptive Statistics | 0.96
- Median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order | Descriptive Statistics | 0.96
- Mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set | Descriptive Statistics | 0.95
- Standard Deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values | Dispersion | 0.95
- Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean | Dispersion | 0.94
- Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable | Distribution Shape | 0.92
- Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in the same data set | Data Analysis | 0.94
- Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set | Dispersion | 0.95

## Probability Theory
- Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain) | Probability | 0.96
- Independent events are events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other | Event Independence | 0.95
- Dependent events are events where the outcome of the first event affects the outcome of the second | Event Dependence | 0.94
- Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event | Conditional Probability | 0.93
- The Law of Large Numbers states that as a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population | Probability Laws | 0.94
- A Normal Distribution (Gaussian) is a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where most observations cluster around the central peak | Distributions | 0.95

## Inferential Statistics
- Population refers to the entire group that is being studied, while a sample is a subset of that population | Inference | 0.96
- Confidence Intervals provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall | Estimation | 0.94
- The Standard Error is an estimate of the standard deviation of a sampling distribution | Sampling | 0.93
- Hypothesis testing is used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population | Hypothesis Testing | 0.94
- A Z-score (standard score) indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean | Standardization | 0.95
- Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables | Regression | 0.94

## Statistical Distributions
- The Binomial Distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with two possible outcomes | Discrete Distributions | 0.94
- The Poisson Distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space | Discrete Distributions | 0.92
- The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution shape | Sampling Theory | 0.93
